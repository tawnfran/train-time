        <!-- Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
  
        * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
          
          * Train Name
          
          * Destination 
          
          * First Train Time -- in military time
          
          * Frequency -- in minutes
        
        * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
        
        * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
        
        * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative! -->
